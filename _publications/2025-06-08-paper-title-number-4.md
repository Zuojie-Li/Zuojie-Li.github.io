A new series of naphthalimide platinum(IV) compounds with dual DNA damage mechanism were designed, synthesized and evaluated for antitumor activities. The platinum(IV) compounds could combine with DNA and cause DNA damage via naphthalimide fragment. Then the platinum(II) complexes released in reductive microenvironment would cause remarkable secondary DNA lesions. Some title compounds exhibit good antitumor activities and are of great potential in overcoming the drug resistance of cisplatin. Moreover, the accumulation of the tested platinum(IV) compounds in whole cells and DNA is remarkably enhanced in comparison with cisplatin and oxaliplatin.
