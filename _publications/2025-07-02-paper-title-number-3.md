# Abstract
Metastasis is a major contributor of death in cancer patients, and there is an urgent need for effective treatments of metastatic malignancies. Herein, ketoprofen (KP) and loxoprofen (LP) platinum(IV) complexes with antiproliferative and antimetastatic properties were designed and prepared by integrating chemotherapy and immunotherapy targeting cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), besides DNA. A mono-KP platinum(IV) complex with a cisplatin core is screened out as a candidate possessing potent anti-proliferative and anti-metastasis activities both in vitro and in vivo. It induces serious DNA damage and further leads to high expression of γ-H2AX and p53. Moreover, it promotes apoptosis of tumor cells through mitochondrial apoptotic pathway Bcl-2/Bax/caspase3. Then, COX-2, MMP-9, NLRP3, and caspase1 as pivotal enzymes igniting inflammation and metastasis are obviously inhibited. Notably, it significantly improves immune response through restraining the expression of PD-L1 to increase CD3+ and CD8+ T infiltrating cells in tumor tissues.
